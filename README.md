# AI Driving Project

**Note:** This project is based on a FreeCodeCamp project originally created using JavaScript. The codebase has been redone utilizing TypeScript, React, Bootstrap, React-Bootstrap, and Sass to enhance functionality and maintainability.

Welcome to the AI Driving project! This project showcases a React and TypeScript-based web application that simulates AI-powered self-driving cars using Bootstrap for styling. In this project, we have developed a simple AI algorithm to control the car's movements within a virtual environment.

## Project Overview

The AI Driving project demonstrates the capabilities of AI in autonomous vehicle navigation within a controlled environment. The main components of this project are:

   - React: The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a fast and efficient way to create interactive web applications.

   - TypeScript: TypeScript is used to add static typing to the JavaScript codebase, making the project more robust and maintainable.

   - Bootstrap: Bootstrap is utilized for responsive and visually appealing user interface components, ensuring that the application looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

   - AI Algorithm: We have implemented a simple neural network that controls the car's movements based on its current position and obstacles within the environment (road borders and traffic).
